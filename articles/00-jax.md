title: Git talk @ JaX 2010

I had the opportunity to speak at the [JaX 2010](http://it-republik.de/konferenzen/jax2010/)
in Mainz, Germany, together with Ralph Guderlei from [exxcellent solutions](http://www.exxcellent.de/).
The JaX is one of the largest Java conferences and primarily aimed at enterprise architectures and SOA.
Our talk concerned distributed version control systems, how they compare to CVS-style systems and how to
integrate them into existing development environments with a special focus on Git. The
[slides](/public/images/dvcs.ppt) are available in German.
