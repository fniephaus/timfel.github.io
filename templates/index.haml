  This is my new blog. I will use it for dumping articles. Expect a lot of Ruby related topics.
  But who am I anyways? I'm currently a student at [Hasso Platt&shy;ner Institute](http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/),
  [University Of Potsdam](http://www.uni-potsdam.de/). In my spare time I work as a software engineer at
  [finnlabs](http://www.finn.de/).
  
  I [tweet](http://twitter.com/konstantinhaase) mainly about tech stuff.
  More non-technical micro-blogging can also be found on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000311509578).
  Most of my code is on [GitHub](http://github.com/rkh), including [this blog's source](http://github.com/rkh/rkh.im).
  I have been contributing to various Open Source projects, including (but not limited to) [Rubinius](http://rubini.us),
  [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/). I also do some infrequent
  [photography](http://flickr.com/khaase).
