  Blog started to track my progress on my RubySoc 2010 project, Ruby C extension support for JRuby.
  And other things, too.

  I'm studying for a master's degree at [Hasso Plattner Institute](http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/),
  [University Of Potsdam](http://www.uni-potsdam.de/). Also, I work as a software engineer at
  [finnlabs](http://www.finn.de/).

  If you want to know what technical topics I'm working on, follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/timfelgentreff).
  Most of the code I'm talking about is on [GitHub](http://github.com/timfel), which is the central hub for my
  contributions to varous FOSS projects.
