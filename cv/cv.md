Profile
=======

I am a Ph.D. student at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam. My
interests are in programming languages and virtual machine design. I focus on
developing language features meant to improve expressibility and VM
technologies to make sure those language features offer good
performance. I am involved in the PyPy/RPython project and various
dynamic language VMs built on top of it, and I am the creator of the
Babelsberg project, which has spawned a family of lanuages that
integrate constraint solving with object-oriented programming. I
prototype much of my research in the self-supporting development
environments Squeak/Smalltalk and the Lively Kernel. I run 10km in
less than 50 minutes.

Education
---------

2010-2012
:    **M.Sc.**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \
     final grade: 1.0 (A+)

     During my master's studies, I focused on programming language
     concepts to facilitate development tools, end-user programming,
     modularity, and meta-circularity especially in distributed and
     parallel programming settings.

    Master's Thesis
      ~ [Comparison, Replay, and Refinement of Communication Traces for Debugging Distributed Failures](public/uni/12FelgentreffThesis.pdf) [![Online Demo](http://is.ieis.tue.nl/staff/pvgorp/share/images/share-logo-16full.png)](http://is.ieis.tue.nl/staff/pvgorp/share/?page=ConfigureNewSession&vdi=Ubuntu12LTS_PeekAtTalk.vdi)

2007-2010
:    **B.Sc.**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \
     final grade: 1.4 (A)

    Bachelor's Thesis
      ~ [Post-mortem Analysis of Debug Traces](public/uni/10AspectToolsOrchideo.pdf)

2005-2007
:    **Abitur**, *PÃ¼ckler Grammar School*, Cottbus, Germany \
     final grade: 1.0 (A+)

2004-2005
:    **AS-level studies**, *Budehaven Community College*, Bude, England

2000-2004
:    **GCSE-level studies**, *Heinrich-Heine Grammar School*, Cottbus, Germany


Experience
----------

Apr 2016-present
:    **Research Assistant**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \

     My research focuses on novel programming paradigms, virtual machines for
     dynamic programming languages, and end-user programming with a special
     interest in computer science education for children.


Oct 2012-Apr 2016
:    **Ph.D. Student**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \

     My Ph.D. research focuses on object-constraint programming, a
     novel approach at combining constraint solvers with dynamic,
     object-oriented languages in a clean and powerful way.


Oct 2014-Dez 2014
:    **Research Visit**, *Nanjing University*, Nanjing, China \

     At Nanjing University I collaborated with researchers on
     emotion analysis in Twitter-like social networks.


Feb 2010-Oct 2012
:    **Working Student**, *Finn GmbH*, Berlin, Germany \

     At Finn GmbH I was involved in plugin development for Redmine.


Oct 2009-Oct 2012
:    **Working Student**, *Hasso Plattner Institute*, Potsdam, Germany \

     I was a tutor at the Software Architecture Group, assisting the
     staff with undergraduate lectures on software engineering and
     software development methodologies, using Squeak/Smalltalk as the
     educational language.


Aug 2011-Nov 2011
:    **Intern**, *VMware*, Beaverton, OR, USA \

     At VMware I was working on the MagLev Ruby VM built on top of the
     distributed GemStone/S Smalltalk object database
     system.
