     During my master's studies, I focused on programming language
     concepts to facilitate end-user programming, modularity, and
     meta-circularity; development tools; virtual machine development;
     as well as distributed and parallel programming.

     Master's Thesis

          for Debugging Distributed Failures](public/uni/12FelgentreffThesis.pdf)

2007-2010
:    **B.Sc.**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \
     in 1.4 (A)

     Bachelor's Thesis

Experience
----------

Oct 2012-present
:    **Ph.D. Student**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \

     My Ph.D. research focuses on object-constraint programming, a
     novel approach at combining constraint solvers with dynamic,
     object-oriented languages semantically and syntactically in a
     clean and powerful way. On the side I am also investigating
     dynamic language VM technologies.


Oct 2014-Nov 2014
:    **Visiting Researcher**, *Nanjing University*, Nanjing, China \

     At Nanjing University I collaborated with researchers on
     emotion analysis in Twitter-like social networks.


Feb 2010-Oct 2012
:    **Working Student**, *Finn GmbH*, Berlin, Germany \

     At Finn GmbH I was involved in plugin development for Redmine


Oct 2009-Oct 2012
:    **Working Student**, *Hasso Plattner Institute*, Potsdam, Germany \

     I was a tutor at the Software Architecture Group, assisting the
     staff with undergraduate lectures on software engineering and
     software development methodologies, using Squeak/Smalltalk as the
     educational language.


Aug 2011-Nov 2011
:    **Intern**, *VMware*, Beaverton, OR, USA \

     At VMware I was working on the MagLev Ruby VM build on top of the
     distributed GemStone/S smalltalk object database
     system. Specifically improving the reflection support and
     developer tools, with a special focus on bringing Ruby web
     application development up to par with Seaside and it's debugging
     tools.
