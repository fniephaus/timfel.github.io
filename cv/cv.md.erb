Profile
=======

I am a member of the Truffle/Graal team at Oracle Labs. I was led
here by my interests in programming languages and virtual machine
design, and my involvement with the PyPy/RPython project and various
other dynamic language VMs. My work revolves around dynamic language
interoperability, connecting them with native C code in a safe manner,
and providing cross-language tool support. I also continue to
collaborate with the Hasso Plattner Institute at the University of
Potsdam. I run 10km in less than 50 minutes.

Education
---------

2012-2017
:    **Dr.rer-nat.**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \
     grade: summa cum laude \
     advisor: Robert Hirschfeld, Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam \
     additional reviewers: \
     Wolfgang de Meuter, Vrije Universiteit Brussel \
     Alan Kay, Viewpoints Research Institute

     In my thesis I presented Babelsberg, a formal design with multiple implementations
     for object-constraint programming to integrate constraint declaration
     and continuous satisfaction with mutable object-oriented structures and
     behavior.

    Doctoral Thesis
      ~ [The Design and Implementation of Object-Constraint Programming](public/uni/Felgentreff_2015_Babelsberg.pdf)

2010-2012
:    **M.Sc.**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \
     final grade: 1.0 (A+)

     During my master's studies, I focused on programming language
     concepts to facilitate development tools, end-user programming,
     modularity, and meta-circularity especially in distributed and
     parallel programming settings.

    Master's Thesis
      ~ [Comparison, Replay, and Refinement of Communication Traces for Debugging Distributed Failures](public/uni/12FelgentreffThesis.pdf)

2007-2010
:    **B.Sc.**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \
     final grade: 1.4 (A)

    Bachelor's Thesis
      ~ [Post-mortem Analysis of Debug Traces](public/uni/10AspectToolsOrchideo.pdf)

2005-2007
:    **Abitur**, *PÃ¼ckler Grammar School*, Cottbus, Germany \
     final grade: 1.0 (A+)

2004-2005
:    **AS-level studies**, *Budehaven Community College*, Bude, England

2000-2004
:    **GCSE-level studies**, *Heinrich-Heine Grammar School*, Cottbus, Germany


Experience
----------

July 2017-present
:    **Senior Software Engineer**, *Oracle Labs Germany*, Potsdam, Germany \

     At Oracle Labs I am a member of the Truffle/Graal group working on
     virtual machine technology for dynamic languages.


Apr 2016-June 2017
:    **Research Assistant**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \

     My research focused on novel programming paradigms, virtual machines for
     dynamic programming languages, and end-user programming with a special
     interest in computer science education for children.


Oct 2012-Apr 2016
:    **Ph.D. Student**, *Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam*, Potsdam, Germany \

     My Ph.D. research focused on object-constraint programming, a
     novel approach at combining constraint solvers with dynamic,
     object-oriented languages in a clean and powerful way.


Oct 2014-Dez 2014
:    **Research Visit**, *Nanjing University*, Nanjing, China \

     At Nanjing University I collaborated with researchers on
     emotion analysis in Twitter-like social networks.


Feb 2010-Oct 2012
:    **Working Student**, *Finn GmbH*, Berlin, Germany \

     At Finn GmbH I was involved in plugin development for Redmine.


Oct 2009-Oct 2012
:    **Working Student**, *Hasso Plattner Institute*, Potsdam, Germany \

     I was a tutor at the Software Architecture Group, assisting the
     staff with undergraduate lectures on software engineering and
     software development methodologies, using Squeak/Smalltalk as the
     educational language.


Aug 2011-Nov 2011
:    **Intern**, *VMware*, Beaverton, OR, USA \

     At VMware I was working on the MagLev Ruby VM built on top of the
     distributed GemStone/S Smalltalk object database
     system.


May 2010-Aug 2010
:    **Ruby Summer of Code Participant** \

     As part of the 2010 Ruby Summer of Code, I built out prototype
     work by Wayne Meissner to add support for Ruby C extensions to JRuby.
